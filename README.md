## Get started
### You have two options:
#### You can use the setup made by me [here][setup] (NOTE: even though I have added a certificate it might trip your antivirus. It is 100% a false positive, you can see the source code!). From here, you can also make your own WinPE image or get access to EXMLE to automate your install.
#### You can also get the [ISO image][iso] if you prefer to use this with Rufus or a virtual machine (more on this later).
### Once you have got image mounted, you can restart into PortableISO and begin setup! Note that this program heavily relies on the internet.
## Disclaimer 
### I am only a student that wants to help other people with installing Windows. If you wish to remove your service from my project, feel free to contact me on GitHub. I have only used resources that are already free to the public, but will still respect your wishes. This project is also on a GNU licence, check the readme.txt for more
## What is it?
#### It is multiple programs that try to make your experience of installing Windows more easier. You have consumer version which is a simple and friendly way to install Windows, even if you are a beginner. You also have a enterprise version which works by making your own custom XML and installing Windows automatically on many systems using PXE (PXE coming soon). Both of them are free and are easily accessible.
