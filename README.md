## Get started
### You have two options:
#### You can use the setup made by me [here][setup], it is recommended you put it into a folder before running. From here, you can also make your own WinPE image or get access to EXMLE to automate your install.
#### You can also get the [ISO image][iso] if you prefer to use this with Rufus or a virtual machine (more on this later).
